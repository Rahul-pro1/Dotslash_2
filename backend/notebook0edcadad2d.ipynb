How can I change my feeling of being worthless to everyone [/INST]  It's important to recognize that you are not alone in feeling this way. Many people struggle with feelings of worthlessness and low self-esteem, and it can be a very difficult and painful experience. However, it's important to know that these feelings are not a reflection of your true worth as a person. You are not worthless, and you are not alone.\n\nIt's important to reach out for support and to talk to someone you trust about how you are feeling. This can be a friend, family member, or mental health professional. Talking about your feelings can help you to process them and to gain a new perspective on yourself and your life.\n\nIt can also be helpful to practice self-care and to engage in activities that make you feel good about yourself and your life. This can include things like exercise, meditation, or spending time in nature. It can also be helpful to set small, achievable goals for yourself and to work towards them. This can help you to feel a sense of accomplishment and to build your self-esteem.\n\nIt's also important to remember that you are not alone in your struggles. Many people have experienced similar feelings and have gone on to lead fulfilling and meaningful lives. You can find support and resources through organizations such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) or the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP).\n\nIf you are in immediate danger, please call emergency services or go to the nearest hospital.\n\nRemember, you are not alone and you are not worthless. You are a valuable and important person, and you deserve to be treated with kindness and respect.\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"user_prompt = \"I don't feel comfortable to share my feelings with anyone.

You don't have to be alone in this, and there are many people and resources available to support you.\n\nIf you're feeling overwhelmed and don't know where to turn, you can start by talking to a trusted friend or family member, or by reaching out to a mental health professional. You can also call a hotline, such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (in the US), at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).
